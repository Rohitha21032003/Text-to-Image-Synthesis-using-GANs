# Text-to-Image-Synthesis-using-GANs

I have given the code for text-to-image synthesis using GANs. Here, I have used CUB-200 Dataset. Also, I have used pretrained Text and Image encoders from attnGAN paper.

You can download dataset from their official website and place it in the folder named data/birds/
The Encoders from AttnGAN can be stored in DAMSMencoders/birds/

The trained model can be stored in models/

After Training the model with the dataset, we can run the guirun.py or guirun1.py (for better gui view) file in our command prompt to see a GUI where we can type our text to get the corresponding image.
